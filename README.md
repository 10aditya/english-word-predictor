# English Word Predictor


Next word prediction is done by using Regex.
For this I created a text file [`full_words.txt`]([https://github.com/10aditya/english-word-predictor/blob/master/full_words.txt]) containing 473K English words by combinig words from ``nltk.corpus.words()`` and from a list by [dwyl] ([https://github.com/dwyl/english-words]).


To run the program:

``python suggestions.py``
